#HOW TO FINISH BECOMING A MEMBER:

Hello! You have successfully completed the first step towards becoming a member of Hackspace Manchester, this is what should happen next.

##Arrange to pay for your membership

Within the next few days you should get an email from Go Cardless. If you don’t, please contact membership@hacman.org.uk.  If you don’t either sign up with go cardless or arrange to pay by bank transfer your membership will not be completed and your details will be deleted after 3 months.

Once your first payment has gone through your membership will be confirmed and your RFID (if you've set one up) will be activated. The RFID allows you access between around 07:00 on weekdays (10:00 at weekends) and 03:00, if you think you are likely to want to be in the building outside these times please ask a board member (email board@hacman.org.uk) for a shutter key. These cost £2.50.

##Come and meet us

If you haven’t come to an open evening (Wednesday nights 19:00 to late) come along and say hi.  You can set up your RFID at the same time. If you turn up at other times **without prior arrangement** you may find that there is no one in the space to let you in and that if there is someone in the space they are a little confused and potentially grumpy about being disturbed.

If you can't make a Wednesday night try contacting the mailing list to see if anyone is available to show you round at another time. Please be aware this is at the discretion of the individual member and there might not always be someone available.

##How to set up an RFID tag

Our door access system works using Mifare, any 13.56 megahertz RFID tag will work with the system.  For example at London hackspace Oyster cards are often used, student ID cards and travel cards will usually work. If you have a card you would like to use please remember to bring it with you.

You can set up your RFID access using the shared PC in the space.  Instructions are stuck to the side of the computer. You will need to know your username and password for the HAC:Man website.  If you don't have an RFID card or the one you were hoping to use proves to be incompatible we have key fob tags available in the space for £2 each.

You may set up an RFID tag at any point, even before you've paid, however it won't be activated until your first payment has cleared. If you cancel your membership or your membership payment bounces your RFID access will be revoked at the point your previous membership payment expires.

#WELCOME: you’re now a hackspace member!

Hello again, welcome to Manchester Hackspace, you're now officially a member.

This email contains some important information so please give it a quick read through.

##Accessing the space

Our space is open 24/7 for our members, in order to access it you will need to set up an RFID tag if you haven't already done so.

The shutter is usually open between around 0700 on weekday mornings (1000 at weekends/bank holidays) and 0300 when Cain and Grain close it. If you think you are likely to want to be in outside these times please ask a board member to arrange a shutter key for you (email board@hacman.org.uk).  These cost £2.50.

If you are likely to be staying in the building after 0300 please make sure you put a sign on the main door asking Cain and Grain not to lock the shutter. They don't always think to check whether there is someone in the building and members have been locked in before. There is no fire exit from the building so not getting locked in is quite important.

###How to get RFID access to the space

If you haven't yet sorted out an RFID tag/card for access to the space please do so as soon as possible, the simplest time to do this is on a Wednesday night (19:00 onwards), however it can be done at other times by arrangement with another member (send a message to the mailing list to arrange this). **Do not rely on there being someone in the space when you turn up if you have not arranged this in advance.**

Our door access system works using Mifare, any 13.56 megahertz RFID tag will work with the system.  For example at London hackspace Oyster cards are often used, student ID cards and travel cards will usually work. If you have a card you would like to use please remember to bring it with you.
