# Welcome to Manchester Hackspace

Thank you for joining Manchester Hackspace, welcome to our community!

## Housekeeping:

If you haven't confirmed your email address please do so - the email might have been eaten by your spam filter they can get a touch over enthusiastic soemtimes.

Next, we'll need to get set up your membership payments. You should have already received an email from GoCardless - the company we use to set up direct debit payments.  Note that the payments will be to "Manchester Makers Ltd" - this is the Hackspace's official company name you can check us out on Companies House: https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08012547.  If you've not received this email yet, or would like to pay by Standing Order, please contact board@hacman.org.uk and we'll get you sorted out. 

## Chat with us

Communities work best when we talk to each other and we're a talkative bunch. We have an extremely active Telegram Group ( https://hacman.org.uk/telegram ) and forum ( list.hacman.org.uk ). Telegram is a mobile/desktop app that allows easy real-time text chat for groups which we use for social chatter while our forum is more focused on discussion of projects, group orders and announcements regarding the space itself. If you're super keen to get involved there's a list of things we need assistance with here: https://hacman.org.uk/we-need-your-help/

## Access

If possible we like to organise for a member to meet you when you first come to the space, give you a quick tour and help you set up RFID access and storage space (if you need it). You can do this before your first payment arrives if you'd like, but your RFID tag will only become active once the payment is confirmed.

## Equipment use

Certain equipment requires an induction so you don't hurt yourself or damage the machines for example: the Laser Cutter, 3D printers, sewing machines, lathe, and any equipment in the workshop with a "This is Bloody Dangerous" tag.  Our volunteer inductors organise these to fit around their schedules, some are ad-hoc and some are at set times and dates.  If you'd like to use one of these machines, ask on telegram or the forum and someone will point you in the right direction.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly via email, or ask the group on Telegram or the forum.
