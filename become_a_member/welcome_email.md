Hello and welcome to Hackspace Manchester!
It's great to have you on board.

## Getting your account set up
Now you've signed up, these are the things you need to do:

* Confirm your email address - you will have received an email asking you to confirm your email address but it may have ended up in your spam folder.
* Set up membership payment - just like a gym membership, we rely on monthly dues. GoCardless is our card provider and will be in touch where you can set up your direct debit, for any amount from £10 with the suggested amount being £25.
* Set up your fob for 24/7 access - come in on an open evening or arrange access with a member, and you can set up your fob. Once the first payment has gone out you will have 24/7 access.

## Get involved in the talk
* We use Telegram where we have our group chats: https://hacman.org.uk/telegram - the chat is very active!
* We also have a forum which you can log into with your details for the website at http://list.hacman.org.uk/, this is more focused and is good for projects and replies.
* Everyone is also welcome at the [Monthly Monday Member's Meeting](http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/MMMM) (4th Monday of the month) where most of the decisions regarding the running of the space are discussed/agreed upon.

## Use the space and our tools
* If you haven't already had a tour, let us know and we will happily show you around.
Some tools require training before use, and it is really important that you get this training before using it, such as the Laser Cutter, 3D printers, sewing machines, lathe, and any equipment in the workshop with a "This is Bloody Dangerous" tag. Our volunteer inductors organise these to fit around their schedules, some are ad-hoc and some are at set times and dates. If you'd like to use one of these machines, ask on telegram or the forum and someone will point you in the right direction.

## The rules of the space
Rule 0 is don't be on fire. 
Rule 1 is always be excellent to one another.

We have a full Code of Conduct, available at http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Code_of_conduct which states the expected behaviours of all members, as well as the consequences for when it isn't followed. This is important to read.

We also have a Basic English version in the space.
