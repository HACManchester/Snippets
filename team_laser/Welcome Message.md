Things you need:
£2 to cover the cost of the induction

Things that are good to have:
A prepared design to cut, in .svg format (this should have a bit to cut, a bit to mark, and a bit to engrave; we will be using fill colours to designate what/where to cut, so strokes will be ignored)
A laptop with Inkscape/Visicut installed (don’t worry if you don’t have one, you can use a computer in the space)

If you have any questions before the induction please do ask, likewise if you want any advice/help with your design. We like to keep the designs cut during training quite small, preferably about 5cm by 5cm, so bear that in mind whilst designing anything!

There’s no need to bring any material to cut, but you are more than welcome to. We have plenty of scrap acrylic/ply/mdf and can offer an A6 piece of ply for the first cut.
