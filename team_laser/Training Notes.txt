# Laser Training Notes

1. Download/Install/Setup Inkscape & Visicut
    * Inkscape isn't necessary, we use it because it's open source and cross platform. If they already have an SVG editor they know and like they are free to use it.
    * TK has a hacky solution to the weird scaling issue in visicut when importing designs not made in inkscape.
1. Offer advice on their prepared design; ie. if it will cut well, issues they may have, whether it will take a long time.
    * Their design should have a cut, a mark, and an engrave to fully demonstrate the laser
1. Ask for their payment of Â£2 for the laser training
1. Explain the moneybox and logbook, detailing why noting the time the laser is used is important
1. Explain the scrap boxes, ensuring it is clear what is suitable scrap and what isn't
    * If they haven't brought their own material they are welcome to use whatever is in the scrap boxes. Do ensure it's laser safe though.
1. Explain laser's safety features
    * Cooler interlock
    * Lid interlock
    * Big red "stop it now" button
    * Laser status whiteboard
1. Show them your example print and walk them through the process
    * Ensure cooler is on and below minimum safe operating temperature
    * Explain how to move the laser bed up/down and how the laser focuses
    * Explain best ordering for printing; ie. Engrave, Mark, Cut Internal, Cut External
    * Show how to make the laser display the cut boundaries
    * Run your cut!
1. Let them have a go, offering guidance as necessary
1. Show them how to vac out the laser tray
1. Ask if they have any final questions; offer a brief run down of everything covered above, explain notes are also on the wiki, and ask them to shout out in the telegram/forum/space if they have any questions
1. Carry on about your day; or not, I'm not the boss of your life
