# You have too much stuff in our space.

## initial approach

Dear $name,

I'm contacting you becuase we have received complaints from several members about overuse of the storage area and, at last count, you were using $num members storage spaces. I have attached photos. The members storage guidelines are here: [http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Hackspace_Rules#Member.27s_Storage_Guidelines](http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Hackspace_Rules#Member.27s_Storage_Guidelines).

As we do not have enough storage available at the moment we are asking all members to reduce their storage to one cube or half shelf prior to the next MMMM ( $date ) when members storage will be discussed.

Best,

## Punitive measures

Dear $name,

We contacted you on $date about the amount of space you are taking up in members storage, beacause of $reason we have allowed you $time_period beyond the inital deadline to deal with this.

[We recognise that you have made a start, however] As of today you are occupying $number of member spaces. This is not accepatble. Please deal with this as a matter of urgency.

If you have not reduced the number of members spaces you are using down to one by $date, we will be forced to remove those of your belongings which exceed your storage allowance from the area. These will be placed in the large project storage area until $date. At which point they will be disposed of.

Best,

$name
on behalf of the board.
