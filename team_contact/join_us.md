In order to become a member you need to go to https://hacman.org.uk/become-a-member and fill in the form.

Once you've done that you will be sent an email confirmation, please follow the link to confirm your account.

You will also be sent an email by Go Cardless (our Direct Debit processor) which will allow you to set up your direct debit. Please be patient as this is currently a manual process. If you don't recieve these emails (do check your spam folder as sometimes the filters can get a touch over enthusiastic) then let us know and we'll re-send them.

You will need an RFID tag to access the space, you can set one up at any point after you have filled in the application however, it wont be operational until we recieve your first payment. If you're in a hurry to join it might be best to send your first payment via bank transfer and either setup a standing order or a Direct Debit for future payments. If you need the bank details please let us know and we'll send you a link to them.

Once your payment is recieved you will be able to organise inductions for the tools you wish to use (we have generalised h&s inductions for most areas such as the woodshop and the metal working area and specific inductions for certain tools for example the laser cutter, the lathe and the sewing machines). Inductions are currently organised via either the telegram group ( https://hacman.org.uk/telegram ) or the forum ( https://hacman.org.uk/list ).
