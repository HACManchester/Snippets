## Design

If you're making new fliers you need to make sure that they are:

- saved as a pdf
- 300dpi or larger
- the correct size

If you're designing something to print to the edge (usually full colour) then you need to ensure you've allowed enough bleed and that all your text is inside the "safe zone". MuPrint have a good set of [instructions](https://www.muprint.com/how-to/create-your-own-artwork/)

## Getting them printed

Send them an email.

1. Always get a quote! The 5 day service is significantlly cheaper than the same day one so if you have enough time then you're best using that one.
1. Ensure you're clear about what you want, include the number and type of each thing you want printed and make sure they have easily distinguishable filenames.

**Sample text**

Hi,

Please could you let me know how much it would cost to get 400 fliers
and 200 business cards printed.

- The fliers are single sided A5 standard 80gsm paper.
- The business cards are single sided on 300gsm card.

We're not in a hurry so we'd like to use the 5 day service please.

Best,

My Name.

## What happens next

Once you've agreed the quote and pick up day if you need to (they're happy for you to pick up within a few days of the minimum period) they will print your fliers.

They will send you an email when they're printed remember that you don't have to go in on the same day.

When you go in to pick them up check to make sure you're collecting the right thing, that the price matches what you were quoted and that they've printed correctly.

Pay them. If you have approval to charge them to the hackspace then take a photo of your receipt and email it to [treasurer@hacman.org.uk](mailto:treasurer@hacman.org.uk).

Congratulations you have fliers :).
